        <h2>About us</h2>
        <div style="text-indent: 3em">Skyfox Inc. is a technology corporation headquartered in the Milky Way. We specialize in the development and implementation of products needed
        for the entrapment and retainment of Skyfoxes. We also continue to make generous donations to the scientific research of the anatomy, genetics and behavior of Skyfoxes as well
        as the study of their natural habitat - the interstellar space of the F-0x star cluster.<br></div>

        <div style="text-indent: 3em">Skyfox Inc. has been established in 1798 by two brothers who have always dreamt of exploring the stars and catching Skyfoxes. Ever since then, we have been
        running the company with these values in mind for more than two hundred years, keeping the brothers' legacy alive, turning Skyfox Inc. into a multinational corporation in the process.
        We have colonized more than a dozen planets and given jobs to countless people in our factories making ®Skyhooks, ®Skylines and ®Skydust. And that's only the beginning!
